# DI725_termproject_2030336

The final project of DI 725: Transformers and Attention-Based Deep Networks. There will
be three phases throughout this project. The first phase will include the preparation of a brief literature survey and a
project proposal. The second phase will cover the preliminary results and benchmarking. The third phase will conclude
the project with results and comparisons.
There will be a base vision-language foundation model (PaliGemma) that is suitable for various tasks including but
not limited to visual question answering, image captioning and object detection. Our task is to generate image
captions. We will structure our own research question, and propose a project to build on top of this foundation.
